My name is Connor Colombe, and I am a PhD candidate in Operations Research at the University of Texas at Austin. I am fortunate enough to be advised by Professor [Ben Leibowicz](https://sites.utexas.edu/leibowicz/). Before joining UT Austin, I received my B.S. in physics and mathematics from [Harvey Mudd College](https://www.hmc.edu/) in 2018. While there, I worked under Professor [Tom Donnelly](https://www.hmc.edu/about/news/experts/tom-donnelly/) on generating chitosan nanoparticles. In 2020, I received my M.S. in Computer Science from the University of Texas at Dallas, working under Professor [Emily Kyle Fox](https://cs.utdallas.edu/people/faculty/fox-kyle/) on a [fast approximation algorithm for computing the continuous Fr√©chet distance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07994).

My current research projects are focused on designing optimal subsidies for emerging technologies (with a specific focus on CCUS) and developing a new family of [quantile-parameterized distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantile-parameterized_distribution) for use in decision analysis. I am generally interested in problems involving, but not limited to, systems modeling and optimization, game theory, algorithm design, and applied probability. In my free time, I enjoy rock climbing and working on recreational math and programming problems. You can find me doing the former on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/connorcolombe/) and check out my blog for the latter!
