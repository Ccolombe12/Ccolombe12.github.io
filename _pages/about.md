My name is Connor Colombe and I am a 3rd year PhD student in Operations Research at the University of Texas at Austin. My advisor is [Ben Leibowicz](https://sites.utexas.edu/leibowicz/). I received my B.S. in physics and mathematics from [Harvey Mudd College](https://www.hmc.edu/) in 2018. While there, I worked under professor [Tom Donnelly](https://www.hmc.edu/about/news/experts/tom-donnelly/) on generating chitosan nanoparticles. In 2020 I received my MSCS in computer science from the University of Texas at Dallas working under professor [Kyle Fox](https://cs.utdallas.edu/people/faculty/fox-kyle/) on a [fast approximation algorithm for computing the continuous Fr√©chet distance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07994).

 My current research projects are focused on energy infastrcture development under uncertainty with a specific focus on carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS). I am generally interested in problems involving but not limited to: energy system modeling, optimization over some stochastic process, efficient algorithm design, and game theory.   In my free time I enjoy rock climbing and working on recreational math and programming problems. You can find me doing the former on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/connorcolombe/) and check out my blog for the latter!
