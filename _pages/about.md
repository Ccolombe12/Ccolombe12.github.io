My name is Connor Colombe and I am a 3rd year PhD student in Operations Research at the University of Texas at Austin. My advisor is [Ben Leibowicz](https://sites.utexas.edu/leibowicz/). My research interests include energy infastrcture developement under uncertainty. In my free time I enjoy rock climbing and working on recreational math and programming problems. You can find me doing the former on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/connorcolombe/) and check out my blog for the latter!
