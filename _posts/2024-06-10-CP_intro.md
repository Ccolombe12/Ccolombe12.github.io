# Optionally, you can add a table of contents to your post.
# NOTES:
#   - make sure that TOC names match the actual section names
#     for hyperlinks within the post to work correctly.
#   - we may want to automate TOC generation in the future using
#     jekyll-toc plugin (https://github.com/toshimaru/jekyll-toc).
toc:
  - name: Problem Statement
    # if a section has subsections, you can add them as follows:
    # subsections:
    #   - name: Example Child Subsection 1
    #   - name: Example Child Subsection 2
  - name: Solution

## Beginning Competitive Programming: Leetcode Milestone

It's no secret that I love to think about and work on math/programming puzzles. Over the past several months I have decided to begin a new hobby: Competitive programming! Not only will this keep me sharp for my upcoming job search post grad school, but it is a great way to continue to bolster my problem solving skills and keep fresh the algorithm design skills that I learned during my time at UTD. 

My favorite resources for finding problems to work on are: [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) (a very popular site for interview style programming problems), [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/) (an online problem archive of problems that have been asked in programming contests around the world), and [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) (another very popular website that hosts high-quality contests). I have been regularly competing in the weekly Leetcode contests and learning a lot in doing so! I plan to reach around 500 problems in Leetcode and achieve a 1900+ rating and then switch to Codeforces since I have heard the problems are more interesting and more mathematical (woo!). I recently broke into the  "knight" level in the Leetcode contests which is currently for those  the top ~ 6% in overall contest performance! You can check out my current contest rating and activity [here](https://leetcode.com/u/ccolombe12)!
