## Jane Street: Hooks 10

My solution to the March 2024 month [Jane Street Puzzle: Hooks 10](https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/hooks-10-index/). 

The problem boils down to finding a feasible arrangement of hooks and cells for the given constraints. Luckily for me and my operations research background, this can essentially be represented as a large integer program (IP)! I saw this was the 10'th iteration of the Hooks puzzles and found ([Gowen100's](https://github.com/gowen100/Jane-Street-Solutions)) IP approach to the previous Hooks puzzle. This was a great opportunity to learn a new tool: The [Z3 theorem prover ](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/z3-3/) from microsoft reasearch. I was able to use what I learned to create the necessary augmentations to solve the newest iteration of the the hooks puzzle! Looking forward to solving the future puzzles with this new tool!
