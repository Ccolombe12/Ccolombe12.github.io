This week's [The Fiddler on the Proof](https://thefiddler.substack.com) puzzle is paraphrased as follows:

> You are planning a picnic on the remote tropical island of $$\pi$$-land. The island’s shape is a perfect semi-disk with two beaches, as illustrated below. We have **Semicircular Beach** (along the northern semicircular edge of the disk) and **Diametric Beach** (along the southern diameter of the disk).
>
> **Part 1:**  
> *If you pick a random spot on $$\pi$$-land for your picnic, what is the probability that it will be closer to Diametric Beach than to Semicircular Beach?*
>
> **Part 2:**  
> *Given the radius of $$\pi$$-land is 1, on average, what will be the expected shortest distance to shore?*

## Solution

### Part 1

The immediate intuition is that the set of points closer to the Diametric Beach than the Semicircular Beach should form a well-defined geometric region. If we can determine that region, denoted $$D$$, the desired probability is simply the area of that region divided by the area of the entire semicircle.

Let the island’s radius be 1, its center be at $$(0, 0)$$, and denote the points on the island by the region $$C$$. Consider a point $$(x, y)$$ on the island, which beach is it closer to? The **distance to Diametric Beach** is just its $$y$$-coordinate. What about the **distance to Semicircular Beach**?

The shortest path from $$(x, y)$$ to Semicircular Beach is along the radial line through $$(0,0)$$ and $$(x,y)$$.[^1] This means the shortest distance to the Semicircular Beach is given by:

$$
1 - \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
$$

Therefore, for a point to be **closer to the Diametric Beach than the Semicircular Beach**, the following inequality must hold:

$$
y \leq 1 - \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
$$

Rearranging:

$$
y \leq \frac{1 - x^2}{2}
$$

Thus, the region $$D$$ of points closer to the Diametric Beach than the Semicircular Beach is:

$$
D = \left\{ (x, y) \in C \mid y \leq \frac{1 - x^2}{2} \right\}.
$$

This region is depicted below:

    <figcaption style="text-align: center;">Figure 2: The region closer to the Diameter Beach than the Semicircular Beach (Blue).</figcaption>
</figure>

Now, we compute the area of this region using integration:

$$
\text{Area}(D)  = \int_{-1}^1 \int_0^{\frac{1-x^2}{2}} dy \; dx = \frac{2}{3}.
$$

Since the total area of the semicircle is $$\frac{\pi}{2}$$, the **probability of being closer to the Diametric Beach is**:

$$
\boxed{\frac{\text{Area}(D)}{\text{Area}(C)} = \frac{2/3}{\pi / 2} = \frac{4}{3\pi}}
$$

### Part 2

We've already done most of the heavy lifting in part 1)! Define $$L$$ as the random variable representing the shortest distance to a beach. At a given point $$(x, y) \in C$$:

- If $$(x, y) \in D$$, the shortest distance is $$y$$.
- If $$(x, y) \in D^c$$, the shortest distance is $$1 - \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$$.

Breaking up the expectation integral into two parts and solving yields:

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}[L] & = \frac{1}{\pi /2} \int_C \min\left(y, 1 - \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\right) dy \; dx \\ 
& = \frac{1}{\pi/2} \int_D y \; dy \; dx + \frac{1}{\pi/2} \int_{D^c} \left(1 - \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\right) dy \; dx\\ 
& = \frac{1}{\pi/2} \int_{-1}^1\int_0^{\frac{1-x^2}{2}} y \; dy \; dx + \frac{1}{\pi/2} \int_{-1}^1\int_{\frac{1-x^2}{2}}^{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}1 - \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}  \; dy \; dx\\
 & = \boxed{\frac{3 \pi - 4}{9 \pi }}
\end{align*}
$$
