This week's [The Fiddler on the Proof](https://thefiddler.substack.com) puzzle is paraphrased as follows:

>There are $$2^n$$ teams playing in a single-elimination seeded tournament. The teams play in a traditional seeded tournament format. That is, in the first round, the sum of teams playing each other is $$2^n + 1$$ (for example seed $$1$$ plays seed $$2^n$$, $$2$$ plays $$2^n - 1$$, etc). If the stronger team always advances, then the sum of opponents’ seeds in the second round is $$2^{n - 1} + 1$$, and so on. 

> Each team possesses a "power index" equal to $$2^n + 1$$ minus that team's seed. For example, team $$1$$ has power index $$2^n$$. In any given matchup, the team with the *greater power index would emerge victorious*. However, March Madness fans love to root for the underdog. As a result, the team with the *lower* power index gets an effective "boost”  $$B$$ applied to their power index, where $$B$$ is some positive non-integer. 

>As an illustration, consider the matchup between the $$2$$ and $$3$$-seeds. The favored $$2$$-seed has a power index of $$3$$, while the underdog $$3$$-seed has a power index of $$2+B$$. When $$B$$ is greater than $$1$$, the $$3$$-seed will defeat the $$2$$-seed in an upset.
>
>Depending on the value of $$B$$, different teams will win the tournament. **Of the $$2^n$$ teams, how many can never win, regardless of the value of $$B$$**?

## Solution

We can start out with some observations. First, for fixed $$B$$, the winner of the tournament is deterministic. This suggests we should define a function $$W_n(B)$$ that for a given $$n$$ and $$B$$ returns the winning seed in the tournament. To solve our problem, we could then determine which values that $$W_n(B)$$ can and cannot take on. The next useful observation is that for $$B > 2^n - 1$$, the value of $$W_n(B)$$ is a constant. Specifically, for $$ B > 2^n - 1$$, the lowest seeded team will always win the tournament. Thus we need only consider the non-integral values of $$W_n(B)$$ on the interval $$B \in [0, 2^n]$$. The last observation we need to consider is that for any two teams playing, say with seeds $$a$$ and $$b$$ with $$a < b$$, the value of $$B$$ for which the winner and loser of the game swap is $$b - a + \epsilon$$ where $$\varepsilon > 0$$ is an arbitrarily small constant. Therefore, as we vary $$B$$ from $$0 \to 2^n$$, the only values of $$B$$ where we may see the value of $$W_n(B)$$ change are of the form $$k + \varepsilon$$ where $$k$$ is a non-negative integer. 

With those observations, our strategy for solving the problem can be made clear. For $$B = k + \varepsilon$$ for $$k \in [2^n - 1]$$, determine the value of $$W_n(B)$$ for the given value of $$B$$ and keep track of the winners as we iterate over the values of $$B$$.  Then simply report the values in $$[2^n]$$ that were not found to be winners. 

```python
from collections import defaultdict
import numpy as np

def gen_bracket(n):
    """
    Recursively generate a seeded bracket for n players (n must be a power of 2).
    Returns a list where consecutive elements form a matchup.
    """
    if n == 1:
        return [1]
    else:
        prev = gen_bracket(n // 2)
        mirror = [n + 1 - seed for seed in prev]
        bracket = [seed for pair in zip(prev, mirror) for seed in pair]
        return bracket

def winner(seedA, seedB, N, B):
    """
    Returns the winner of the matchup seedA vs seedB in an 
    N person tournament with boost B.
    """
    # make sure seedA is lower seed 
    if seedA > seedB:
        seedA, seedB = seedB, seedA
    power_rankA = N + 1 - seedA
    power_rankB = N + 1 - seedB + B
    if power_rankA > power_rankB:
        return seedA
    else:
        return seedB
    

def W(n, B):
    """ 
    The winner of a 2^n person tournament with boost B. 
    """
    N = 2 ** n 
    bracket = generate_bracket(N)
    while True:
        # keep simulating until one team left 
        if len(bracket) == 1:
            return bracket[0]
        else:
            winners = []
            for i in range(0, len(bracket), 2):
                seedA = bracket[i]
                seedB = bracket[i + 1]
                winners.append(winner(seedA, seedB, N, B))
            bracket = winners
```

Then to get the possible winners for a given tournament size of $$2^n$$ and to compute 
the number of teams that cannot win, we can run the below code. 

```python
n = 6 # solve for 2^6 = 64 teams 
    
can_win = defaultdict(bool)
# B-values where winner could swap values
B_space = [i + eps for i in range(1, 2 ** n + 1)] 
for b in B_space:
    champ = tournament_winner(n, b)
    can_win[champ] = True
winners = list(sorted(list(can_win.keys())))
print(f'The teams that CAN win are {winners}')
print(f'There are {2 ** n  - len(winners)} teams that cannot win')
print(f'The function that predicts this is {2 ** (n - 1) - (n - 1)}')
```


Since this code is for general $$n$$, we can compute the number of teams that cannot 
win for several values of $$n$$, see table 1.

Some of you may notice a pattern in this sequence. If we let $$a_n$$ be the number of teams that cannot win in a $$2^n$$ team tournament, then we see the pattern emerge 

$$a_n = 2 a_{n - 1} + (n - 3), \; a_2 = 1$$

for $$n \geq 2$$. Which would suggest that 

$$\boxed{a_n = 2^{n - 1} - (n -  1)}.$$


We won't attempt prove this conjecture here, but the pattern holds for $$n \leq 20$$.

Lastly, it would be interesting to see the plot of $$W_n(B)$$ for various $$n$$ so that we can get a sense of which teams are capable of winning. Below in Figure 1 is a gif that illustrates the function $$W_n(B)$$ for various values of $$n$$. We see that as $$n$$ grows the shape of the function begins to approach some interesting limiting shape!

Upon inspection it appears there is a recursive description of how these curves relate to one another. Here is a very rough description of how they appear related.  We see for a given $$n$$, for $$ B > 2^{n - 1} $$, the $$W_n(B)$$ is non-decreasing in $$B$$ and produces $$2^{n - 2} + 1$$ unique winners in that range. The curve for $$W_{n + 1}(B)$$ has the same values as $$W_n(B)$$ for $$ B < 2^{n - 1} $$. Then for $$B \in [2^{n - 1}, 2^n]$$, the previously increasing portion of the curve is reflected downward about its start point, and then for $$ B > 2^n$$, the curve has the same monotonic behavior but for $$2^{n -1} + 1$$ values. Note that for all $$n \geq 2$$, $$W_n(B)$$ is a one-to-one function. That is,  no winner is ever repeated for different $$B$$. If this behavior is indeed an accurate description of the curves (as it empirically appears to be), then this would prove our conjecture about $$a_n$$ [^1].
