The problem statement is as follows:

You start off with one amoeba. Every minute, this ameoba can either:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Do nothing
	\item Die
	\item Split into two amoebas
	\item Split into three amoebas
\end{enumerate}

Each of these actions has an equal probability of occurring. All further amoebas behave the
exact same way. What is the probability that the amoebas eventually die off? \textit{Challenge:
Suppose now the amoeba has the ability to split into up to $n$ amoebas. For large $n$, what is probability that the amoebas eventually die off now?}
