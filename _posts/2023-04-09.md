The problem statement is as follows:

You start off with one amoeba. Every minute, this ameoba can either:

	* Do nothing
	* Die
	* Split into two amoebas
	* Split into three amoebas
	
Each of these actions has an equal probability of occurring. All further amoebas behave the
exact same way. What is the probability that the amoebas eventually die off? *Challenge:
Suppose now the amoeba has the ability to split into up to* $n$ *amoebas. For large* $n$*, what is probability that the amoebas eventually die off now?*
