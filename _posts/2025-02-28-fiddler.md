## How Many Rabbits Can You Pull Out of a Hat?

I found a new source of puzzles: the excellent Substack page [The Fiddler on the Proof](https://thefiddler.substack.com) run by Zach Wissner-Gross. This week's puzzle is paraphrased as follows: 

> Suppose I have a hat with $3n$ small toy rabbits: $n$ are red, $n$ are green, and $n$ are blue. I shuffle the rabbits around and randomly draw them out one at a time without replacement (i.e., once I draw a rabbit out, I never put it back in again).
>
>Your job is to guess the color of each rabbit I draw. For each guess, you know the history of the rabbits already drawn. So if we’re down to the final rabbit in the hat, you should be able to predict its color with certainty.
>
>Every time you correctly predict the color of the rabbit I draw, you earn a point. If you play optimally (i.e., to maximize your expected points), **how many points can you expect to earn on average?**

## Solution

We can solve this using [Dynamic Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming)! We represent the current state as a tuple $(r, g, b)$, where $r, g,$ and $b$ denote the number of rabbits of each color remaining in the hat. Let $J(r, g, b)$ be the maximum expected score starting from state $(r, g, b)$. Our goal is to determine $J(n, n, n)$. We can solve for $J(n, n, n)$ by developing a **recurrence relation** on the current state. We begin with the base cases.

### Base Cases

- If there are no rabbits left, i.e., we are at state $(0, 0, 0)$, then there are zero points left to obtain, implying
  $J(0, 0, 0) = 0.$
- If any of $r, g,$ or $b$ are negative, we define:
  $$J\left(r, g, b \right) = 0, \; \text{if any } r < 0, g < 0, \text{or } b < 0.$$
  While negative counts don't have a physical interpretation, this condition will allow us simplify our recurrence relation.

### Recurrence Relation

For a general state where $r, g, b \geq 0$ and at *least one of them is positive*, we can determine the expected score maximizing guess for the next rabbit's color by considering each option and selecting the best one. The probabilities for the next colors are:

- The probability of drawing a red rabbit $ P_r = \frac{r}{r + g + b} $.
- The probability of drawing a green rabbit $ P_g = \frac{g}{r + g + b} $.
- The probability of drawing a blue rabbit $ P_b = \frac{b}{r + g + b} $.

Given these, the expected scores from guessing each color are:

$$
J\left(r, g, b \mid \text{guess red}\right) = P_r \cdot (1 + J(r - 1, g, b)) + P_g\cdot J(r, g - 1, b) + P_b\cdot J(r, g, b - 1),
$$
$$
J\left(r, g, b \mid \text{guess green}\right) = P_r\cdot J(r - 1, g, b) + P_g\cdot (1 + J(r, g - 1, b)) + P_b\cdot J(r, g, b - 1),
$$
$$
J \left(r, g, b \mid \text{guess blue}\right) = P_r\cdot J(r - 1, g, b) + P_g\cdot J(r, g - 1, b) + P_b\cdot (1 + J(r, g, b - 1)).
$$

To find the optimal expected score at state $(r, g, b)$, we take the maximum over these three choices.

$$
\boxed{J\left(r, g, b\right) = \max \left\{ J\left(r, g, b \mid \text{guess red}\right), J\left(r, g, b \mid \text{guess green}\right), J\left(r, g, b \mid \text{guess blue}\right) \right\}}.
$$

The optimal guess is the color that achieves this maximum.

### Implementation

Now that we have a recursive formulation, we can efficiently compute $J(r, g, b)$ using dynamic programming. Let’s code this up in Python!

```python
from functools import cache
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from fractions import Fraction

@cache
def max_point(r, g, b):
""" Returns the maximum expected score under optimal play from the state
(r, g, b) """
    # Base Cases
    if r < 0 or g < 0 or b < 0:
        return 0
    elif r == 0 and g == 0 and b == 0:
        return 0
    # Main recurrence Case 
    if r > 0 or g > 0 or b > 0:
        total_rabbits = r + g + b
        Pr, Pb, Pg = r / total_rabbits, b / total_rabbits, g / total_rabbits
        
        guess_red = (Pr * (1 + max_point(r - 1, g, b)) +  
            Pg * max_point(r, g - 1, b) +
            Pb * max_point(r, g, b - 1))
        
        guess_green = (Pg * (1 + max_point(r, g-1, b)) +
                       Pr * max_point(r - 1, g, b) +
                       Pb * max_point(r, g, b - 1))
                       
        guess_blue = (Pb * (1 + max_point(r, g, b - 1)) +
                      Pr * max_point(r - 1, g, b) +
                      Pg * max_point(r, g - 1, b))
        
        return max(guess_green, guess_red, guess_blue)

def optimal_score(n):
    return max_point(n, n, n)
```
