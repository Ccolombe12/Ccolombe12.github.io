This week's [Fiddler on the Proof](https://thefiddler.substack.com) puzzle is paraphrased as follows: 
# Problem Statement 
> **Part 1)** You are placing many, many dominoes in a straight line, one at a time. However, each time you place a domino, there is a 1 percent chance that you accidentally tip it over, causing a chain reaction that tips over all dominoes you’ve placed. After a chain reaction, you start over again.
>
>**If you do this many, many times, what can you expect the median number of dominoes placed when a chain reaction occurs (including the domino that causes the chain reaction)?** 
> 
> **Part 2)** You’re placing dominoes again, but this time the probability of knocking each domino over and causing a chain reaction isn’t $$1/100$$, but rather $$10^{-k}$$, where $$k$$ is a whole number. When $$k = 1$$, the probability of knocking over a domino is 10 percent; when $$k = 2$$, this probability is 1 percent; when $$k = 3$$, this probability is 0.1 percent, and so on.
>
>**Suppose the expected median number of dominoes placed that initiates a chain reaction is $$M(k)$$. As $$k$$ gets very, very large, what value does $$M(k)/10^k$$ approach?**

# Solution

Let's start off with a common problem solving strategy: *generalizing the problem*. Suppose that the probability that any given domino falls over as we place it is $$p$$. Let $$T$$ be a random variable denoting the turn when the first dominoe falls over. We can immeadiately see that $$T \sim Geo(p)$$ with CDF 

\begin{equation}
\Pr[T \leq t] = 1 - (1 - p)^t \quad \forall t > 0.
\end{equation}

The median is the integral value of $$t = M$$ for which this is equal to $$1/2$$. Plugging in $$1/2$$ to the LHS and solving for $$M$$ yields

\begin{equation}
\boxed{M(p) = \frac{\log 2}{\log(1 - p)}}
\end{equation}
