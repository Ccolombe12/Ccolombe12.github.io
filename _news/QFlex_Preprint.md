My latest paper ***The QFlex Distribution***, coauthored with Professors [J. Eric Bickel](https://www.me.utexas.edu/people/faculty-directory/bickel) and [Benjamin D. Leibowicz](https://www.me.utexas.edu/people/faculty-directory/leibowicz), is out as preprint on [SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5930859)! In this paper, we introduce a new framework for constructing quantile-parameterized distributions from an arbitrary set of quantile assessments. At a high level, our approach takes a finite collection of point assessments from an unknown distribution and produces a high-fidelity estimate of the underlying distribution under very mild assumptions. This system enables decision makers to build meaningful probabilistic models from sparse expert assessments.

    The QFlex system can match a wide variety of distribution shapes and boundedness. Here is it creating density functions from quantiles sampled from a set of bounded distributions.
