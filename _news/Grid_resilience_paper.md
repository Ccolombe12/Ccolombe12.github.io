My paper [Optimal Resource Placement for Electric Grid Resilience via Network Topology](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0951832024000851) in collaboration with Balasubramanian Sambasivam, John Hassenbein, and Benjamin Leibowicz was just accepted for publication in [Reliability Engineering & System Safety](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/reliability-engineering-and-system-safety). This was a really neat study with some theoretical work on optimal resource placement in certain network topolgies under uncertainty.
