My latest research paper, ***Optimal Subsidies for CCS: A Stackelberg Game Analysis*** (working paper linked [here](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5168632)), is now under review at [EJOR](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/european-journal-of-operational-research). This was an exciting collaboration with Professor Leibowicz, where we develop a game-theoretic model examining the strategic interaction between a subsidy-offering government and a COâ‚‚-producing firm. Check it out!
