I am starting a Summer internship doing Quantitative Research for the [Multi-asset Strategies Group](https://www.trs.texas.gov/Pages/investment_team_asset_allocation.aspx) at the Teachers Retirement System of Texas.

 This is the group the manages the pension fund for all educators in the state of Texas and is one of the largest in the world. I will be conducting research into new currency trading signals and improving the optimization of portfolios.
