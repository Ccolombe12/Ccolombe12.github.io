I recently attended the USAEE conference in Chicago, Illinois where I presented my work on *The Effects of Policy Uncertainty and Risk Aversion on Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage Investments*. For my presentation and and submission, I received the best student paper award! Thanks Professor Leibowicz for your support!
