I was honored to have received the [IISE](https://www.iise.org/Annual/conference) *Best Student Paper Award* in the Energy Systems division for my paper, [Optimal Subsidies for CCS: A Stackelberg Game Analysis](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5168632) and its accompanying [presentation](assets/pdf/Optimal_Subsidies_for_Carbon_Capture__A_Stackelberg_Game_Analysis.pdf).

 I had a great time presenting my work at the conference and listening to some excellent operations research talks!
