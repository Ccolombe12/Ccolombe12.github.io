I am honored to have recently received a [University Graduate Continuing Fellowship](https://gradschool.utexas.edu/funding/fellowships/grad-school/continuing) from the **UT Graduate School**! This fellowship will allow me to fully dedicate myself to producing high-quality research and empower me to explore the topics that interest me most during the remainder of my time at UT.
