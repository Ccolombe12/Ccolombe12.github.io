	abstract = {We describe the first strongly subquadratic time algorithm with subexponential approximation ratio for approximately computing the Fr{\textbackslash}'echet distance between two polygonal chains. Specifically, let \$P\$ and \$Q\$ be two polygonal chains with \$n\$ vertices in \$d\$-dimensional Euclidean space, and let \${\textbackslash}alpha {\textbackslash}in [{\textbackslash}sqrt\{n\}, n]\$. Our algorithm deterministically finds an \$O({\textbackslash}alpha)\$-approximate Fr{\textbackslash}'echet correspondence in time \$O((n{\textasciicircum}3 / {\textbackslash}alpha{\textasciicircum}2) {\textbackslash}log n)\$. In particular, we get an \$O(n)\$-approximation in near-linear \$O(n {\textbackslash}log n)\$ time, a vast improvement over the previously best know result, a linear time \$2{\textasciicircum}\{O(n)\}\$-approximation. As part of our algorithm, we also describe how to turn any approximate decision procedure for the Fr{\textbackslash}'echet distance into an approximate optimization algorithm whose approximation ratio is the same up to arbitrarily small constant factors. The transformation into an approximate optimization algorithm increases the running time of the decision procedure by only an \$O({\textbackslash}log n)\$ factor.},

	title = {The effects of policy uncertainty and risk aversion on carbon capture, utilization, and storage investments},
	abstract = {Many model-based decarbonization pathways include substantial carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS), and engineering cost estimates suggest that these technologies should be profitable to deploy under current incentives, such as the 45Q tax credits in the United States. However, CCUS investments have been slow to materialize. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which policy uncertainty and investor risk aversion may explain the limited buildout of CCUS infrastructure to date. To do so, we develop a two-stage stochastic programming model for optimal CCUS infrastructure network design that incorporates policy uncertainty and risk aversion as novel features. We then apply it to an empirically parameterized case study of the Texas-Louisiana Gulf Coast region. Our results show that the current 45Q incentive levels make a fair number of CCUS projects profitable even if they were to be discontinued after ten years. Therefore, while future policy uncertainty reduces CCUS development, the maximum effect size is only a 7\% decline in expected total CO$_2$ captured. Interestingly, more significant risk aversion could accelerate CCUS investment since a more risk-averse investor prefers to fully exploit the current, known incentives rather than preserve CO$_2$ storage capacity for future, unknown incentives.},
