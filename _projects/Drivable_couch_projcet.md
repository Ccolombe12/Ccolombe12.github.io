Back in Spring 2018, me and my good friend Alex Goldstein were recipients of the HMC Shanahan Project Fund, a Harvey Mudd College student research grant. This grant is awarded by Harvey Mudd College to students with a creative/useful/fun project idea. Since I was a freshman, I had always wanted to build a remote controlled couch that I could sit on and drive up and down the college's quad on a sunny California day. My senior year, I finally got the conviction (and funding!) to make that freshman dream happen!

Our couch used two powerful DC motors that could easily carry 2 ~ 3 people around HMC's campus. We opted for [differential steering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_steering) since it was the easiest to implement with our RC remote. We placed a Bluetooth speaker in one the arm-rests, and slapped some cheap LED lights underneath! It was a great capstone project (in addition to my *actual* undergraduate thesis that is)! Special shout out to [professor Dodds](hmc.edu/about/news/experts/zachary-dodds/) who was our advisor on the project. As well as [professor Breznay](https://www.hmc.edu/about/news/experts/nicholas-breznay/) who took the inaugural test drive.

Here we are on presentation day giving a brief demo! Sorry for the sound, we needed some WD-40 before this!
