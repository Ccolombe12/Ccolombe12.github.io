<p>You start off with one amoeba. Every minute, this amoeba can either:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Do nothing</li>
  <li>Die</li>
  <li>Split into two amoebas</li>
  <li>Split into three amoebas</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these actions has an equal probability of occurring. All further amoebas behave the
exact same way. What is the probability that the amoebas eventually die off?</p>

<p><em>Challenge: Suppose now the amoeba has the ability to split into up to</em> $n$ <em>amoebas. For large</em> $n$<em>, what is probability that the amoebas eventually die off now?</em></p>
<hr />

<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>

<p>Let $p$ be the probability that an amoeba and all of its decedents eventually die out. We can then calculate this probability by conditioning on each of the actions the amoeba could take</p>

\[\begin{align}
p = \frac{1}{4} +\frac{1}{4} p^2+ \frac{1}{4} p^2 + \frac{1}{4} p^3. \label{eq:n4}
\end{align}\]

<p>Each term on the right hand side representing the events that the amoeba dies, does nothing, splits in two, and splits in three respectively. Since the any two amoebaâ€™s behave independently of one another, if there are $k$ amoebas, the probability that all $k$ and their respective descendants dies out is $p^k$. Solving for $p$ in (\ref{eq:n4}), yields two solutions in $[0,1]$. Namely, $p=1$ and $p = \sqrt{2} - 1$. But which of the two is the solution?</p>

<p>We can show that that $p = \sqrt{2} - 1$ is indeed the true probability by instead considering the probability that a given amoeba and its ancestors die out in at most $k$ minutes minutes, denoted $P_k$, is bounded above by $\sqrt{2} - 1$ and is eq.</p>

<p>We can prove this by induction. Clearly $P_1 = \frac{1}{4}$ since there is only one way for the a given amoeba to last one minute and $\frac{1}{4} &lt; \sqrt{2} - 1$. Assume this holds for $k$. What is the probability a given amoeba and its ancestors die out in at most $k + 1$ minutes? Well from (\ref{eq:n4}) we have 
\(\begin{align*}
P_{k+1} &amp; = \frac{1}{4} +\frac{1}{4} P_{k}^2+ \frac{1}{4} P_{k}^2 + \frac{1}{4} P_{k}^3 \\ 
&amp; = \frac{1}{4}\left( 1 + P_k + P_k^2 + P_k^3\right) &amp;&amp; (\text{Plug in } P_k &lt; \sqrt{2} - 1) \\ 
&amp; &lt; \sqrt{2} - 1
\end{align*}\)</p>

<p>completing our inductive step. Thus as $k \to \infty$ our probability of extinction $P_\infty = p$ can never get to 1. Implying the only possible solution is $\boxed{ p = \sqrt{2} - 1}$.</p>

<p>If we consider the case where now the amoeba now has the options to split into as many as $n$ amoebas, can we get an estimate of $p$? It turns out we can!</p>

<p>Consider the generalized form of (\ref{eq:n4})</p>

\[\begin{align}
p &amp; = \frac{1}{n+1}\sum_{k=0}^n p^k\\ 
 &amp; =\frac{1}{n+1}\left(\frac{1-p^{n+1}}{1 - p}\right)\\ 
 \implies &amp; \\ 
 p (n+1) &amp; = \frac{1-p^{n+1}}{1 - p} \label{eq:gen}.
\end{align}\]

<p>Note that for large $n$, the value of  $p = \frac{1}{n+1}$ begins to approximate the solution to (\ref{eq:gen}). We plotted the numerical solution to (\ref{eq:gen}) as function of $n$ (labeled $F[n]$ in the figure) and the function $g(n) = 1/n$ and from the figure below we can see they begin to agree very quickly!</p>
